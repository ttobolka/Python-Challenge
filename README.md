# Python-Challenge
This is my submission for the Module 3 Challenge: Python Challenge.

My sincerest apologies about getting so behind on this assignment: between still trying to balance my work life with this class and helping my friend getting married next get ready for his wedding, I forgot about submitting this assignment. I will make sure to be prompt with the due dates going forward in this course.

I utilized chatgpt for these two sets of code primarily, although the PyPoll code came much easier after figuring out the first code for PyBank.
